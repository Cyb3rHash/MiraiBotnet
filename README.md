Precautions & Safety Guidelines
1. Run in a Safe Environment
Before running this code, it is strongly recommended to use a Virtual Machine (VM) or sandbox environment. This will ensure that the code does not affect your primary operating system or network.

To set up a sandbox/VM:

Use a hypervisor like VirtualBox or VMware to create a virtual machine.
Install a clean operating system (preferably Linux-based) inside the VM.
Configure the VM to have no network access or a segregated network to prevent the code from accessing external networks.
2. Antivirus & Security Software
Ensure that your antivirus and security software is up-to-date and running in your VM or sandbox. The source code may be flagged as malware by antivirus programs, so running it in a protected environment is essential.

3. Do Not Run on Your Primary System
Running the Mirai Botnet code on your primary machine or any system connected to the internet can expose it to potential security risks. Always use isolated, offline environments for research purposes.

4. Code Understanding & Education Only
This code should only be used to study malware behavior, research botnet defense mechanisms, and analyze IoT vulnerabilities. Do not deploy this code for any purpose other than educational research.

Running the Code (Educational Use Only)
Setup the environment: Install the necessary dependencies (gcc, golang, mysql-server, etc.) inside your VM.
Compile the code: Use gcc and go to compile the source code in a controlled, isolated environment.
Monitor and Analyze: Use tools like Wireshark to monitor network traffic and sandboxing tools to prevent any interactions with your host system.
